Mazer is a a new command-line tool for managing `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__ content.

The name Mazer comes from a character from Ender's Game, Mazer Rackham, that Wikipedia describes as "the half-Māori captain 
who singlehandedly stopped the Second Invasion by realizing that the Buggers are a hive mind. Due to his inability to pass
on his knowledge, he was forced to spend fifty years at relativistic speeds (eight years to Rackham) so that he could train
the next commander — Ender Wiggin."

A mazer is also a hardwood drinking vessel.

Mazer is distributed under the `GNU General Public License v3.0 <https://github.com/ansible/mazer/LICENSE>`__.

.. note::
    
    Mazer is experimental, and currently only available for tech-preview. Use with lots of caution! It is not intended for use in
    production environments, nor is it currently intended to replace the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool.

    If you're installing Ansible content in a production environment, or need assistance with Ansible, please visit the `Ansible Project <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__,
    or the `Ansible docs site <https://docs.ansible.com>`__.
