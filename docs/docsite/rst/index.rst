About Galaxy
`````````````

Galaxy is a hub for finding and sharing Ansible content.

Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides
pre-packaged units of work known to Ansible as roles.

Roles can be dropped into Ansible PlayBooks and immediately put to work. You'll find roles for provisioning
infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday.

Use Galaxy's Search page to find roles for your project, then download them onto your Ansible host using
`ansible-galaxy`, the command line tool that comes bundled with Ansible.

Help other Ansible users by sharing the awesome roles you create. Maybe you have a role for installing and
configuring a popular software package, or a role for deploying software built by your company. Whatever it is,
use Galaxy to share it with the community.
